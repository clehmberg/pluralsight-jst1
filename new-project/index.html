      <h2>Story line.</h2>
      <p>Busy day at the restaurant because, a popular(humorous name) rock band is in town, causing Max to be crazier than usual, patrons demand recooks, and Max threatens the restaurant guests, Sunny calming him down. Meanwhile Ick & Glib and Glib's metal head minions gather and celebrate the band in the restaurant parking lot, scaring regulars like Phillip. Phillip complains, but the restaurant staff are to busy to cater to his complaints, causing him to storm out, and start a ridiculous campaign against the band, with minions in suits. People outside the restaurant overhear a speach from the lead singer inciting fans to get the anti band campaign, causing a ridiculous and hilarious battle in the street between rockers/fans and Suits/elders/soccermoms, complete with walkers, minivans, guitars, briefcases full of money (increase pandemonium) and drumsets. Rocker/Metal versions of Ick & Glib lead the fans. Max and sunny are too busy working to acknowledge the battle, Prophet sits on the roof of the restaurant with his 'hippy' buddies, they look on at the battle, humorously preaching peace. During the battle, Glib is constantly saving Ick from harm, until Prophet swoops in putting the kids on the roof, where they sit with the hippies and instantly 'teleport' to a random paradise for a bit, then the show ends with Ick and Glib passed out with hippies and max (randomly) passed out ontop of the restaurant. </p>
