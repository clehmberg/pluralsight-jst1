        <p> Eric Jensen has always liked to entertain and make people laugh. Not only is he a great actor, improv comedian and playwrite, he also loves people, which is why he founded the Off Broadway Theatre in 1994 with his wife, Sandy Jensen. Their mission
          is to not only make people laugh but to help people grow as individuals, either as actors, tech crew or volunteers. The Off Broadway Theatre (OBT) is a nonprofit organization, because of this they rely on volunteers to help keep the laugh's
          coming. On a daily basis they work with many volunteers (some from rough and sheltered backgrounds) to help them build new skill sets or improve the skills they already have.</p>

      <p>Eric has a hand in making almost everything that goes into the productions at the OBT and is a master at making props from nothing but blue foam and garbage. He designs all of the set pieces and makes sure everything is ready to go by opening night.</p>

    <p>I have worked at the OBT for the last 5 years. I have met some of the most wonderful people there, including my best friend, and I truly cannot picture my life without Eric, the OBT or my OBT family, because thats what we are, a family, and it allstarted with Eric Jensen, and his passion to make people laugh.</p>
